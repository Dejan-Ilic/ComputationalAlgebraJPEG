# Computer Algebra JPEG
Interactive course on JPEG

1) Install Julia from https://julialang.org/downloads/
2) Download the file(s) in this project (on github, click "Code" and "Download ZIP") and unpack them
3) Start the Julia REPL
4) In the Julia REPL: `using Pkg; Pkg.add("Pluto")`
5) After the installation finished: `using Pluto; Pluto.run()` (then your browser will open a Pluto Notebook)
6) In Pluto Notebooks, open the downloaded files(s).
	1) **julia_intro.jl** provides an introduction to Julia. It is recommended but not mandatory to go through this notebook before class.
	2) **jpeg.jl** is the notebook that we will use in class.

(!) These notebooks might take a while to load, so try to load them well before class.

(*) This notebook is based on a report I wrote in 2020. The report, written in Dutch, will be made available to students taking the course.
